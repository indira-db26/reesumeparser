# reesumeparser
Multi-Stage Resume Parser (MVP) built with Python &amp; spaCy for structured JSON extraction from PDF/DOCX files.
📄 Multi-Stage Resume Parser (Full-Stack MVP)

🌟 Overview

This project is a full-stack, end-to-end solution designed to process unstructured resume documents (PDF, DOCX) and extract key candidate information into a clean, normalized JSON format. It demonstrates core competencies in NLP, API development, and data pipeline architecture.

Key Technologies: Python, Flask, spaCy (Natural Language Processing), RegEx, HTML/JavaScript.

⚙️ Architecture & Pipeline

The parser operates in a multi-stage pipeline:

File Ingestion: Uploaded files (or batch files) are converted to raw text (using pdfplumber and python-docx).

Core Extraction: A hybrid approach is used:

spaCy: Custom rulesets and pre-trained models are utilized for complex, context-dependent entities (Education, Experience, Skills, Job Titles).

RegEx: Precise patterns are used for fixed-format data (Email, Phone Number, URLs).

API Deployment: The logic is exposed via a Flask API endpoint (/parse_resume) to allow real-time processing from the web frontend.

Frontend Demo: A simple HTML/JavaScript interface facilitates file uploads and displays the final JSON output.

🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Git

All work must be done within a Virtual Environment (venv).

Installation & Setup

Activate Environment:

.\venv\Scripts\Activate


Install Dependencies: Install all required libraries, including flask-cors for successful frontend connection.

(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv) python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


How to Run the Application

The application requires two components to run simultaneously: the API backend and the static frontend demo.

Start the API Server (Terminal 1):

(venv) python app.py


(The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000)

Access the Frontend:

Open the index.html file in your web browser (e.g., double-click the file).

Use the interface to upload a PDF or DOCX file.

📑 Final Structured Output Example

The primary goal of the project is to produce clean, actionable data. Below is an example of the structured JSON output generated by the parser.
